                       Hello, world! In this post we would like to tell you the story of creation of the mobile game called "Robot Alan", motivated by a simple desire 
                   to "make a game!". It has resulted in more than three years of making alterations, giving up and starting all over again. 
                   We’ll try to show you the whole way, and how my friend and I has evolved and changed under influence of this small game. 
                   </p>                 
               
                   <p>
                       Briefly about us. My name is Alexander and my friend’s name is Jan. In those times (2011) I was mainly engaged in automating some bureaucracy in 
                   Java and administrating Solaris systems. Accordingly in the future game I was responsible for development. Jan is a creative person with a technical 
                   background who risked to became an artist (by this let’s assume a general concept of man working with graphics in all its forms), and in our mini-project he 
                   was responsible for all the images, sounds, animations and others beautiful things. It is worth noting that as I had no experience in the game dev so Jan was 
                   not a "professional" in his field (in hungry days in University we had created a few web sites, well, who didn’t?!). Nevertheless, we wanted to make the game 
                   completely by ourselves, without the involvement of others. And we managed it.
                   </p>                   
               
                   <p>
                       The desire to create a game came long before the concrete idea of the game mechanics. I tried 3 or 4 ideas before I found the one. 
                       The game is inspired by the school years, 8-9 grades, when we worked in an environment "Robot land" in computer science lessons (this is 
                       a software for teaching children). In this environment several executors are introduced, one of which is the incomparable "Cucaracha." 
                       "Cucaracha" is a cockroach located on the two-dimensional field, that is able to follow simple commands like "Move forward, backward, left, 
                       right, again, if" with the help of which he moved letters. In fact one should make a cockroach construct certain words using these commands. 
                       A kind of a variation on the Turing machine.

                       Under the influence of nostalgia I wanted to do something similar in the form of a mobile game. I was so inspired that it took me a half of a 
                       day to implement the game’s prototype. I programmed in Java using libGDX framework (why Java? I thought they’d created minekraft in 
                       it and that’s quite OK =) )<br/><br/>

                       <div style="text-align:center;">It looked like that :)</div>

                       The idea of the game is simple. The player collects stars on a level. A level consists of multi-colored blocks. In order to control your 
                       character you need to create commands in the following form:<br/><br/>
                   </p>
                   
                   <p style="text-align: center;">
                       <b>IF</b> &lt;above, below, on left, on right&gt; &lt;RED, GREEN&gt; <b>THEN MOVE</b> &lt;LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP&gt;<br/><br/>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       The gameplay was tested and we liked it very much (it’s not surprising, there were so much endorphins in my blood that I could had made a 
                       religion of tic tac toe). After that we had to come up with a character and its environment. Curiosity then just was about to get to Mars 
                       and we decided - “well, that's a great theme: Mars rover! And we may release the game for the important event!” (This was the first mistake 
                       with a deadline - for about 3 years).

                   </p>                   
               
                    <p>
                        Under the influence of nostalgia I wanted to do something similar in the form of a mobile game.<br/><br/>
                        I was so inspired that it took me a half of a day to implement the game’s prototype. I programmed in Java using libGDX framework 
                        (why Java? I thought they’d created minekraft in it and that’s quite OK =) )<br/><br/>                    
                    </p>                   
                
                    <p>
                        So a prototype of a Mars rover was designed, later known as the "vacuum cleaner". Not only because it was similar to a modern 
                        "smart" vacuum cleaner, but also because Jan produced a trailer where the "cleaner" was moving against all the laws of physics 
                        (note the direction of the tracks and the surface). For comparison, the very first and the final versions:

                    <p>
                        Of course, now it looks very funny but then it seemed like we just had to change few details.<br/><br/>
                        Meanwhile the development of the game continued. Android smartphones were chosen as the target platform, even though we didn’t have one. 
                        But the opportunity of libGDX to develop a common desktop application and then just built it for Android was very encouraging. 
                        So we thought we would find the device when needed. Our naivete became clear only when I tried to built the game on a friend’s smartphone. 
                        Instead of 2.5k fps on desktop there were 17 fps on a top smartphone of that time. Of course it was connected with the lack of experience 
                        in a game dev. There were a lot of things to be optimized (at least render only the viewport instead of the entire game). After optimization 
                        I achieved 60 fps on the same smartphone, but it became clear that further game development without a device was very silly.                   
                    </p>                   
                
                    <p>
                        As soon as I launched our game on the tablet I realized that it looked much cooler on that screen (as much as 7 inches :) )! 
                        It became a possession and led to almost a complete redesign of the game (extension of the play field, design and mechanics of the game). 
                        It should be noted that all my proposals to rewrite the game Jan acclaimed enthusiastically. Maybe because I vividly described how it would 
                        be cooler, or he just knew that what we had then is not what we wanted to share with others.               
                    </p>                   
                </div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center;">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        By then we almost run out of motivation. In good months I managed to devote the game a couple of days. The main motivator was the renewed art of Jan.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We needed a change, a breath of fresh air. A purchase of my first iPad (2) became this change. It was much more productive then Samsung 
                        and ofcourse we wanted to run our game on it. From the very beginning of LibGDX its creators promised to implement the possibility of 
                        compiling java games on iOS (via Mono) in the future, but then it hadn’t been done yet (as far as I know, now it is). No possibility, 
                        but I really wanted to - so I started to look towards Objective-C. I played with it for three days, with reference to the cocos2d. I made 
                        the most basic prototype and realized that it didn’t bring me any pleasure. I didn’t like the language and didn’t have a desire to study it. 
                        Partly it was because I realized that the only way I was going to use it was particularly for this game.
                    </p>                   
                
                    <p>
                        Then I stumbled on CocoonJS. It is a commercial product that allows you to pack HTML/JS game developed on Canvas in iOS application 
                        with performance "close" to the native. An  analogue of PhoneGap but for graphics. There is also an open source version of this tool called 
                        "Ejecta" but I decided that since CocoonJS is a commercial product the quality is likely to be better. In addition it was a beta and free.
                    </p>                   
                
                    <p>
                        The times of rewriting the game in JavaScript began. I knew JavaScript a little, I would characterize my knowledge as "jQuery - that's all 
                        I need." It took me three days to write almost a complete analog of java version (it turned out that it’s much more faster when you know 
                        what to implement and have all the images, sprites and other stuff). I became more and more interested in JavaScript language as I was 
                        developing the game. After C and Java World all it’s features like special behavior of ‘this’, prototypes, closures 
                        and (NaN! == NaN) == true - became a kind of puzzle that made it very interesting to study. I chose CAAT JS as a framework for the game. 
                        As far as I'm concerned now this is not the most famous and popular framework but then guys from CocoonJS promoted 
                        it (they must have something to do with its development). The framework is very simple and solved all the problems for us (luckely there 
                        is nothing supernatural in our game).
                        <br/><br/>
                        After that once I decided to rewrite the game using generators in ES6. Fortunately I didn’t have enough time for that so I 
                        got lukewarm and decided we would produce the game faster ‘as is’.

                        But it turned out quite different. This time Jan became an initiator. He had watched the cartoon "WALL E" and was inspired by 
                        the contrast of technology and nature.<br/>
                        After discussion we decided that it was necessary to add this contrast in the game and this led to the various green elements in the menu:
                    </p>

                        In addition to that Jan decided to try his hand in 3D modeling. So a prototype of our character, later called a "chair", was created:
                    </p>                   
                </div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center;">
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/07.jpg" alt="">                        
                    </p>                   
                </div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        Jan began studying 3D which he found really fascinating and it led to a series of new versions of our robot:
                    </p>                   
                </div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12" style="text-align: center;">
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/08.jpg" width="800" alt="">                        
                    </p>                   
                </div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        In addition to changing the graphical part of the game it changed the direction of our thoughts. Previously we tried to diversify 
                        the game and to add new features (lasers, portals and many other different kinds of garbage), but then a full minimalism overcame us. 
                        We cut almost all the elements that seemed even a little far-fetched that made the game more "holistic". The refusal of  text in the 
                        game became the apogee of minimalism. The only text is our names and the old-school phrase "GAME OVER". Such a zealous minimalism made 
                        the game much less clear for the ones who are not yet familiar with it, but we felt some inner satisfaction in that way.
                    </p>                   
                
                    <p>
                        Our friends whom we showed the game treated it differently. In general everyone liked it but for most people, especially non-technical ones, 
                        it was not very clear. Certainly it has brought the shade of sadness, but those who liked it changed the situation. As a result, 
                        we've added the first few training levels. The final version of the game is still not the ideal which is somewhere in our imagination, 
                        but it is something that we don’t shame to show others.

                        We reworked the game very often because of various reasons: new technologies, new colors and new ideas. Without these alterations 
                        the game would had never been born. As for us, the progress of Jan I think is particularly noticible in the contrast of his first 
                        works and the result. Now Jan is seriously engaged in 3D-animation and works in one of St. Petersburg's studio as an animator. I migrated 
                        from backend to frontend: now I work as a senior developer and program mainly on JavaScript.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The game has brought us not only the experience but also many pleasant memories and knowledge about new areas for personal development.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Of course, the game is not a masterpiece. Its main value will probably remains between us, but it would be great if there is someone 
                        who likes to play it =).
